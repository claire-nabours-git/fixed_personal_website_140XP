    "section": "",
    "text": "About This Report\nThis project utilized a 2^2 factorial experimental design with blocking to examine the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and caffeine. The study measured changes in memory task performance among participants across treatment combinations, while controlling for age and time of day. Through statistical modeling, ANOVA analysis, and diagnostic checks, the report evaluates the main and interaction effects of the two stimulants. The goal of this work was to better understand how substances commonly consumed by students influence short-term memory performance and whether they interact in meaningful ways.\nMy Contributions\nI helped run the experiment itself, ensuring treatments were administered properly and data collection was consistent across participants. I also played a role in designing the factorial experiment and explaining its structure, including the blocking factors of age and time of day. I also worked on verifying and interpreting the model assumptions and contributed to writing the discussion section, where we connected statistical results to broader implications for cognitive performance and student behavior."

We applied exploratory data analysis, transformations, and feature engineering to address skewness, categorical effects, and multicollinearity. Six models were developed and compared using five-fold cross-validation with RMSE as the evaluation metric. XGBoost achieved the best performance, highlighting the importance of nonlinear modeling in capturing complex consumer purchasing patterns.\nMy Contributions\nI created the exploratory data analysis and data visualization, producing plots and summaries to guide preprocessing decisions. I contributed to the design of the preprocessing pipeline, including transformations and feature engineering. I also implemented and evaluated linear, ridge, and lasso regression models, comparing their performance to other approaches. In addition, I wrote the Exploratory Data Analysis and co-wrote the Preprocessing sections of the report and contributed to the Results and Discussion."

By applying models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, the project evaluates how demographic, political, and socioeconomic features contribute to predicting winners. The report provides insight into which variables most strongly influence results.\nMy Contributions\nI focused on developing and optimizing the models for this project. Specifically, I built logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine models, incorporating preprocessing techniques and Bayesian optimization to improve performance. In addition, I conducted the exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover trends in the dataset and guide model design. I also contributed to the final report by writing the EDA and model development sections, ensuring the methodology and findings were clearly communicated."

    "text": "About This Report\nThis project investigated how demographics and attitudes toward women influence voting behavior, with a focus on support for women in public office and political party preference. Using multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest models, the study examined the relative importance of attitudinal versus demographic predictors. Exploratory data analysis, variable importance plots, and refined modeling approaches were used to identify key factors influencing public office support and political alignment, while assessing model assumptions and addressing potential overfitting. The goal was to understand the role of gender attitudes in shaping political behavior and to provide insights into promoting equitable perceptions of leadership.\nMy Contributions\nI contributed to writing the introduction, abstract, conclusion, and limitations and recommendations, ensuring clarity and cohesion across the report. I developed the model variables section, describing both demographic and attitudinal predictors, and worked on checking model assumptions and interpreting interaction effects to prevent overfitting. These efforts helped frame the project’s methodology, interpret statistical findings, and connect results to broader implications for support of women in leadership and political behavior."
