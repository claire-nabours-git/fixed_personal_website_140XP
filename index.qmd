Hi! I’m Claire Nabours and I'm a senior at the University of California, Los Angeles majoring in Statistics and Data Science.

Through my Product Management and Software Engineering Fellowship, I have gained experience guiding products from user discovery to MVP delivery, aligning cross-functional teams, prioritizing features, and ensuring technical execution drives real-world outcomes. You can learn more about my work and product experience in the project showcase tab!
