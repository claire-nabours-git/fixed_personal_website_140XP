**About This Report**

This blog was created as part of UCLA’s DESMA 9 course (Art, Science & Technology). It documents my weekly reflections, event write-ups, and projects that explore the intersections of art, science, and technology. Through it, I connected course concepts to real-world examples, exhibitions, and research while developing a personal voice in analyzing how creativity and innovation intersect across disciplines.


**My Contributions**

I researched, wrote, and designed all blog posts, focusing on connecting course material to real-world examples. My work included analyzing museum exhibits, lectures, and artistic movements, and presenting them through a personal and reflective lens. I also managed the overall structure and look of the blog to ensure it was clear and engaging.
