**About This Report**

Masked Miles is a digital humanities project that examines how COVID-19 reshaped travel in the United States, focusing on California and Florida. By comparing state-level policies, mobility trends, and case rates, the project reveals how contrasting responses to the pandemic influenced travel behaviors, tourism, and public health outcomes—highlighting the human story behind pandemic travel.

**My Contributions**

I served as the project manager, coordinating workflow and deadlines to ensure smooth collaboration. I also explored and analyzed the data, created visualizations to support the narrative, and contributed to writing the narrative itself. In addition, I worked on the design and development of the website, shaping both the overall look and the main content pages.
