**About This Report**

This project analyzed Amazon consumer survey data to predict monthly state-level sales using regression modeling techniques. We applied exploratory data analysis, transformations, and feature engineering to address skewness, categorical effects, and multicollinearity. Six models were developed and compared using five-fold cross-validation with RMSE as the evaluation metric. XGBoost achieved the best performance, highlighting the importance of nonlinear modeling in capturing complex consumer purchasing patterns.

**My Contributions**

I created the exploratory data analysis and data visualization, producing plots and summaries to guide preprocessing decisions. I contributed to the design of the preprocessing pipeline, including transformations and feature engineering. I also implemented and evaluated linear, ridge, and lasso regression models, comparing their performance to other approaches. In addition, I wrote the Exploratory Data Analysis and co-wrote the Preprocessing sections of the report and contributed to the Results and Discussion.
