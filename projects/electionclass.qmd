**About This Report**

The Election Winner Classification Report is a project that investigates the use of predictive modeling for classification of U.S. election outcomes. By applying models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, the project evaluates how demographic, political, and socioeconomic features contribute to predicting winners. The report provides insight into which variables most strongly influence results.


**My Contributions**

I focused on developing and optimizing the models for this project. Specifically, I built logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine models, incorporating preprocessing techniques and Bayesian optimization to improve performance. In addition, I conducted the exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover trends in the dataset and guide model design. I also contributed to the final report by writing the EDA and model development sections, ensuring the methodology and findings were clearly communicated.
